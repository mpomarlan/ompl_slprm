# Installation

If you use Linux or OS X, then all dependencies can be installed either through a package manager or by OMPL's build system. In other words, you probably don't have to compile dependencies from source.

To compile OMPL the following two packages are required:
- [Boost], version 1.40 or higher (version 1.44 or higher recommended), and
- [CMake], version 2.8.2 or higher.

To be able to generate python bindings you need to install the [Python] library and header files.

Below are more detailed installation instructions for [Linux](#install_linux), [OS X](#install_osx), and [Windows](#install_windows).

\note If you are using [ROS], please see the [ROS interface to OMPL][omplros].

# Installation on Linux {#install_linux}

Below are installation instructions for Ubuntu Linux. Similar steps can be taken for other distributions, but package names may not be identical.


## Ubuntu Linux {#install_linux_ubuntu}

###  Installation from repository

For Ubuntu 10.04 (lucid), 11.10 (oneiric) and 12.04 (precise), Willow Garage maintains deb packages for the latest version of OMPL. All you need to do is add the repository to your list of sources:

    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu `lsb_release -sc` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
    wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

and install OMPL:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-ompl


### Installation from source

- If you are using Ubuntu 11.04 or earlier, the supplied Boost version is too old. You need Boost 1.44+ for full functionality. You can install Boost from [source](http://www.boost.org/users/download), but it is simpler to add another repository:

      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:boost-latest/ppa
      sudo apt-get update

- The default version of CMake should suffice. If needed, you can download the latest version from [here](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html).
- Install Boost and CMake

      sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev cmake

  Some versions of Linux offer multiple versions of Boost. It is strongly advised to install only one version.
- To be able to generate documentation, generate Python bindings, build the ODE extension, the following packages are also needed:

      sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz python-dev libode-dev curl

- Create a build directory and run cmake:

      cd ompl
      mkdir -p build/Release
      cd build/Release
      cmake ../..

- If you want Python bindings, type the following two commands:

      make installpyplusplus && cmake . # download & install Py++
      make update_bindings

- Compile OMPL by typing \c make.
- Optionally, run the test programs by typing <tt>make test</tt>.
- Optionally, generate documentation by typing <tt>make doc</tt>.
- If you need to install the library, you can type <tt>sudo make install</tt>. The install location is specified by <tt>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</tt>. If you install in a non-standard location, you have to set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to the directory where the OMPL python module is installed (e.g., $HOME/lib/python2.7/site-packages).


## Fedora Linux

Thanks to Rich Mattes, OMPL core is available as a package for Fedora:

    yum install ompl

Installation from source is also possible if dependencies listed above are installed.


# Installation on Mac OS X {#install_osx}

It is easiest to install the OMPL through [MacPorts], a package manager for OS X. However, if you feel adventurous, it is possible to install OMPL's dependencies with [HomeBrew](#install_homebrew) and compile OMPL yourself.


## MacPorts {#install_macports}

- Install [MacPorts].
- If you do not need to modify or see the source code of OMPL, then the easiest way to install OMPL is with the MacPorts \c port command:

      sudo port sync
      sudo port install ompl

  This is it. You are done. It will take quite a while, though, to download, build, and install OMPL and all its dependencies. It is recommended to let this running overnight. Demo programs can be found in \c /opt/local/share/ompl.
- If you downloaded the source distribution of OMPL, then you need to install the dependencies Boost, and CMake. Optionally, you can also install the Open Dynamics Engine, Py++, and the Python libraries and headers. If you have MacPorts installed, type the following:

      sudo port sync
      sudo port install boost cmake ode py27-pyplusplus-devel

- It is __very__ important that you use the same installed version of Python for all dependencies and OMPL. If you are using MacPorts, then you __must__ use the MacPorts version of python 2.7 (most likely installed in <tt>/opt/local/bin</tt>). To make this version the default python version, make sure <tt>/opt/local/bin</tt> appears before <tt>/usr/bin</tt> in your PATH. You can add a line like this to your <tt>${HOME}/.bash_profile</tt>:

      export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH

  Next, execute the following command:

      sudo port select python python27

  You can check if the MacPorts-installed python 2.7 is the default one by typing the following command:

      ls -l `which python`

- To be able to generate documentation, Doxygen is also needed:

      sudo port install doxygen

- Create a build directory and run cmake:

      cd ompl
      mkdir -p build/Release
      cd build/Release
      cmake ../..

- If you want Python bindings, type the following command:

      make update_bindings

- Compile OMPL by typing \c make.
- Optionally, run the test programs by typing <tt>make test</tt>.
- Optionally, generate documentation by typing <tt>make doc</tt>.
- If you need to install the library, you can type <tt>sudo make install</tt>. The install location is specified by <tt>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</tt>. If you install in a non-standard location, you have to set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to the directory where the OMPL python module is installed (e.g., $HOME/lib/python2.7/site-packages).

## Homebrew {#install_homebrew}

_Thanks to [Andrew Dobson](https://plus.google.com/104214233559576935970/about) for these instructions!_ __These instructions are somewhat experimental, however, and we haven't tested them ourselves.__ Email us if you have suggestions to improve these instructions.

- Install [Homebrew].
- Run <tt>brew doctor</tt> to make sure that everything is ready to go.  If not, follow its instructions until it is ready.
- Type the following commands:

      brew install boost cmake assimp ode

- To be able to generate documentation, Doxygen and Graphviz are also needed:

      brew install doxygen graphviz

- Create a build directory and run cmake:

      cd ompl
      mkdir -p build/Release
      cd build/Release
      cmake ../..

- If you want Python bindings, type the following commands:

      make installpyplusplus
      cmake .
      make update_bindings

- Compile OMPL by typing \c make.
- Optionally, run the test programs by typing <tt>make test</tt>.
- Optionally, generate documentation by typing <tt>make doc</tt>.
- If you need to install the library, you can type <tt>sudo make install</tt>. The install location is specified by <tt>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</tt>. If you install in a non-standard location, you have to set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to the directory where the OMPL python module is installed (e.g., $HOME/lib/python2.7/site-packages).


# Installation on Windows {#install_windows}

It is possible to run OMPL natively on Windows, although it must be stressed that __extensive testing on Windows is not performed__ at this time, and running OMPL on Windows is considered experimental. For best performance, the [MinGW] compiler is recommended. Visual Studio can also be used to build the core OMPL library, but currently it is not possible to generate the python bindings for OMPL with this compiler. However, if the bindings are generated with MinGW, the bindings can be compiled by Visual Studio with some minor tweaks to the code (not recommended, unless you are an experienced Windows developer).


## Required Dependencies

- [CMake]
- [MinGW][] (recommended) or Visual Studio compiler
- [Boost], version 1.44 or greater.

  It is recommended to make a complete Boost compilation from source.  If using Visual Studio, this process can be automated using the <a href="http://www.boostpro.com/download">BoostPro</a> installer. Once complete, set the environment variables <tt>BOOST_ROOT</tt> and <tt>BOOST_LIBRARYDIR</tt> to the locations where Boost and its libraries are installed.  The default locations are <tt>C:\\Boost</tt> and <tt>C:\\Boost\\lib</tt>.  Ensure that <tt>BOOST_LIBRARYDIR</tt> is also in the system PATH so that any necessary Boost dlls are loaded properly at runtime.


## Optional Dependencies (for Python bindings)

- A __32-bit__ version of [Python] 2.7.  Ensure that this is installed __before building Boost__ so that Boost.Python is properly compiled.
- Ensure that Python is added to the system <tt>PATH</tt>.
- Py++: To generate the Python bindings, Py++ and its dependencies must be installed. A batch file has been included to automate this process (analogous to the Linux/Mac installation) that can be executed via cmake. Instructions can be found [here](installPyPlusPlus.html).  Note that this process assumes the MinGW compiler, and installs gccxml to <tt>C:\\gccxml</tt>.  You will need to be in a shell with administrator privileges to execute this batch file.  Once installed, it is recommended that you open a new shell to realize the new environment settings.


## Build

- Once the dependencies are installed, CMake can be used to generate MinGW makefiles or a Visual Studio solution
by specifying a specific GENERATOR:

    cd ompl
    mkdir build
    cd build
    mkdir Release
    cd Release
    cmake -G "GENERATOR" ../.. [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install]

The CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable is set to <tt>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ompl</tt> by default.

### MinGW
- The CMake generator for MinGW is <tt>"MinGW Makefiles"</tt>
- To generate the python bindings (optional), execute the update_bindings make command before compiling:

      mingw32-make update_bindings

  __Note:__ <tt>update_bindings</tt> is _never_ run automatically. If you change any of the OMPL header files, you need to regenerate the bindings for the changes to be reflected in the Python modules. See also the [more detailed documentation on generating python bindings](\ref updating_python_bindings).
- Use <tt>mingw32-make</tt> to build OMPL.
- If you wish to install OMPL, use the install command to copy the binaries, demo code, and other resources to the cmake install prefix.  Note that you will need to be in a shell with administrator privileges to install to the default directory.

      mingw32-make install

- Make sure to add the install path's \\lib subdirectory to the PATH so that the DLLs are found when code is loaded.


### Visual Studio
- The CMake generator for Visual Studio depends on the version of Visual Studio to generate a solution for. The generator for VS 2010 is <tt>"Visual Studio 10"</tt>, and the generator for VS 2008 is <tt>"Visual Studio 9 2008"</tt>. Consult the CMake documentation for other generators.
- Open ompl.sln and build the solution.  A static library will be created (ompl.lib) to link your code against, as well as several demo programs.
- You can install OMPL by building the "INSTALL" project inside of the solution.  Note that this will attempt to copy files to <tt>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ompl</tt> (the default).  The installation will fail unless Visual Studio is opened with administrator privileges, or a non-system install prefix is specified when cmake is run.
